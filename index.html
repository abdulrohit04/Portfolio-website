          <h3>Money Donating Website</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of this website is to help raise funds for children 
            who are in need of basic necessities like food, shelter, and 
            education. The website has a user-friendly interface that makes 
            it easy for visitors to donate money securely and conveniently.

          <h3>Black Jack & Dice Game</h3>
          <p>
            The Black Jack and Dice game is a web-based game that features 
            both Black Jack and Dice games. The games are designed to be easy
             to play and understand, making it suitable for all players. 
             The game has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to 
             navigate and enjoy.

            To create this game, I utilized my knowledge of JavaScript to

          <h3>Passenger Counter & Lead Tracker</h3>
          <p>
            The Passenger Counter app is a web-based tool that enables you to 
            easily track the number of people who have entered and exited your
             establishment. The app features a user-friendly interface that
              allows you to set up and customize your counters quickly and 
              efficiently. It also includes a range of reporting options, 
              so you can keep track of your data over time and make informed 
              decisions about your business.

            The Lead Tracker Chrome extension, on the other hand, is a 
            browser-based tool that helps you keep track of your leads and 
            contacts. The extension integrates seamlessly with your browser, 
            allowing you to quickly add and organize new leads with just a 
            few clicks.

          <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
          <p>
            My portfolio website showcases some of my recent work, which 
            includes projects that range from simple, elegant designs to 
            complex, interactive web applications. Each project was built 
            using the latest front-end technologies, including HTML5, CSS3,
             and JavaScript, and I made sure to implement best practices to
